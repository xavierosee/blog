Hi, I’m Xavier Rosée. Up to [2020][2020] I was a Mobile Marketing Professional with a strong focus in branding and strategy. Over the course of my career I’ve witnessed the evolution of this role from best-practice-informed to a data-informed and data-driven. 

After a couple of years self-teaching Data Analysis and Python, my business and livelihood were hit by COVID-19. Taking this opportunity to reflect on the industry, the marketing role and my future, I’ve decided to pivot my career toward a Data and Product role.

This space covers **Data Science** and **Data Analytics** along with their use among the mobile and gaming spaces and the tech industry at large. I will share the things I find useful in my quest to Data Science, with the hope that it can help someone in their own journey.

For those interested in launching their Data Science career, I’m outlining the steps I’m taking to fast-track my pivot to Data Science in [my first post][first_post].

_Thanks for reading!_
