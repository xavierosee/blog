As part of [Le Wagon Data Science bootcamp][bootcamp], there are weekly online talks with thought leaders and professionals from the Dev or Data fields. For one of these talks, I interviewed Audrey Vanderghinste, Data Analyst at Dalberg Group, who worked with the UNICEF for the Ugandan Health Ministry.

It was a really interesting conversation, Audrey shared a lot of ðŸ’Ž gems  about the role of a Data Analyst within a consultancy/advisory business, and it's always inspiring to hear passionate people talking about their jobs, most notably when it involves social impact and data-for-good.
