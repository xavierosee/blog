I’ve got work to do! It’s not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there’s nothing I can do about it right now. It’s such a long way from here.</p>

<p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Your eyes can deceive you. Don’t trust them.</p>

Don’t be too proud of this technological terror you’ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>

  <li>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There’ll be no one to stop us this time!</li>
  <li>Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.</li>
  <li>I want to come with you to Alderaan. There’s nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</li>
</ol>

<p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I call it luck. I’m trying not to, kid. Alderaan? I’m not going to Alderaan. I’ve got to go home. It’s late, I’m in for it as it is.</p>

<p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What?! Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Don’t be too proud of this technological terror you’ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>

<p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I find your lack of faith disturbing. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.

<p>Don’t be too proud of this technological terror you’ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Your eyes can deceive you. Don’t trust them. What?! I don’t know what you’re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan–</p>

<p>You mean it controls your actions? I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you’re going.</p>
